# Optimization


The goal of this lab is to write a simple optimization function in **R** which estimates the global minimum of a convex differentiable function $f(x)$.  Specifically, consider the function 
$$f(x)=\frac{-\log(x)}{1+x}, \ \ x>0,$$
where $\log(x)$ is the natural logarithm of $x$.  We seek to estimate the value of $x>0$ such that $f(x)$ achieves its global minimum.  For example, the global minimum of the function $g(x)=x^2-4x+3$ is at $x=2$. The minimum of $g(x)$ can easily be computed using the vertex formula for quadratic functions, i.e., $x=-b/(2a)=4/(2*1)=2$.  In most cases, the minimum does not have a closed form solution and must be computed numerically.  Hence we seek to estimate the global minimum of $f(x)$ numerically via gradient descent.    

# Tasks

1) Using **R**, define the function $$f(x)=\frac{-\log(x)}{1+x}, \ \ x>0.$$ Test the points $f(0)$ and $f(2)$.  

```{r}
fopt <- function(x){
  y=-log(x)/(1+x)
  y
}
fopt(0)
fopt(2)
```

2) Plot the function $f(x)$ over the interval $(0,6]$. 

```{r}
curve(fopt, from = 0, to=6)
```

3)  By inspection, were do you think global minimum is located at?  
I think the global minimum is located at x= infinity

4) Define a **R** function which computes the difference quotient of $f(x)$, i.e., for $h>0$, 
$$\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.$$ This function should have two inputs; $h$ and $x$.  Name the difference quotient function **diff.quot**.  Note that for small $h$,  this function is the approximate derivative of $f(x)$. 

```{r}
diff.quot <- function(x, h){
  p = (fopt(x+h)-fopt(x))/h
  p
}
```

5) Plot both the difference quotient function **diff.quot** and $f(x)$ over the interval $(0,6]$.  Fix $h=.0001$ to construct this plot.  Comment on any interesting features.
```{r}
curve(fopt, from = 0, to=6)
curve(diff.quot(x,.0001), from = 0, to=6, add=TRUE)
```

6) Write a **R** function named **basic.grad.descent** that runs the basic gradient descent algorithm on the function $f(x)$.
The function should have inputs:
```{r}
basic.grad.descent <- function(x){
  # initialize your stuff
  iter <- 1
  max.iter <- 10000
  stop.deriv <- 1*10^(-10)
  h <- .0001
  step.scale <- .5
  diff <- Inf
  # loop the algorithm 
  while(iter < max.iter & abs(diff.quot(x,h))>stop.deriv){
  diff <- diff.quot(x,h)
  
  x=x-step.scale*diff
  
  iter <- iter+1
  }
  print(x)
  print(fopt(x))
  print(iter)
  iter<max.iter
}
basic.grad.descent(1)
```

\begin{enumerate}
\item Initial value  {\bf x}
\item Maximum iterations  {\bf max.iter} with default 10000. 
\item Stopping criterion {\bf stop.deriv} with default 1e-10. 
\item Derivative step size {\bf h} with default .0001.  
\item Step size {\bf step.scale} with default .5. 
\end{enumerate} The function should have outputs:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The value $x$ that yields the minimum of $f(x)$. 
\item The minimum value of $f(x)$. 
\item The number of iterations the algorithm took to reach the minimum.
\item A logical indicator displaying whether or not the algorithm converged.  
\end{enumerate}

7)  Check the optimal value using the base **R** function **nlm()**.  

```{r}
nlm(fopt, 1)
```
